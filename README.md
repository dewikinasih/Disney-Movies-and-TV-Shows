Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization

Since I love to watch movie, I'm interested to know more about what kind of movie or tv shows on Disney plus with the highest IMDb score. Also, I want to find out the pattern of movie or tvs hows produced each year. is there any pandemic effect that causes the differnce in pattern.

So, I start this project by searching the data on kaggle. then I clean it first, and finally I make some visualization with car chart, pie chart, and line chart
I used python seaborn and matplotlib in this case, of course with pandas and numpy.
