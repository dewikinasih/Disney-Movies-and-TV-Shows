# Disney-Movies-and-TV-Shows
Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization

Since I love to watch movie, I'm interested to know more about what kind of movie or tv shows on Disney plus with the highest IMDb score. Also, I want to find out the pattern of movie or tvs hows produced each year. is there any pandemic effect that causes the differnce in pattern.

I used python seaborn and matplotlib in this case, of course with pandas and numpy.
