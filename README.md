Since I love to watch movie, I'm interested to know more about what kind of movie or tv shows on Disney plus with the highest IMDb score. Also, I want to find out the pattern of movie or tv shows produced each year. is there any pandemic effect that causes the differnce in pattern.

So, I start this project by searching the data on kaggle. then I clean it first, and finally I make some visualization with Bar chart, Pie chart, and Line chart

I used python seaborn and matplotlib in this case, of course with pandas and numpy.

[Here is the code](https://github.com/dewikinasih/Disney-Movies-and-TV-Shows/blob/371e02e85da40db8923bd03ba3c959d66876dfa8/disneyplus.ipynb)
